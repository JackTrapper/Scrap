##### Beta 5.1
* Fixed several bugs causing add/remove item functionalities not to work properly

##### Beta 5
* Updated for 3.2
* Scrap is going trough a "transitional phase": there are many upcoming changes, which will make Scrap profiles from previous versions incompatible with the new version. An additional addon, //Scrap BetaUpdater//, has been included, which will make the transition of enUS profiles a smooth process, but users with other clients may find transitioning their junk lists a difficult process. Our apologies, but this will be better for the users on a long term.
* Added a new module: //Scrap Merchant//, which will make the Scrap merchant button load on demand. What does this means? Faster loading and less use of memory and cpu on startup.
* Now Scrap does not allows items which can't be sold to the merchant to be added to the junk lists.

* Removed the profiles chat messages
* More changes coming in a close future...
